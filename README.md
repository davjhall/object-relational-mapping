# object-relational-mapping

## Description

This is a project showing off backend therefore its functionality is recorded. I created this project to help aid retail stores with their inventory through an online database using MySql, Express.js, API routes and Sequelize. Through this database they'll be able to delete, create, update and retrieve any item in their system.
